Introduction

Linux Kernel Programming is one of the most exciting thing for the beginners in
System Programming. With time a lot of excellent books were published on it but
the books were written to cover everything about the Linux Kernel and thus had
a widespread scope. These books enabled to a lot of people to take kernel
programming as their career chocices or as a hobby.

I have been seeing a lot of queries on the ``kernelnewbies`` mailing list where
people are requesting for the documents to start with. Most of them want to go
through a guided course or something. 

People (even I) generally suggest them the following books:

#.  The Design Of Unix Operating System
#.  Linux Kernel Development
#.  Understanding The Unix Kernel

For the learners who can't wait to get into code - I have written this small book.

This book uses Ubuntu Server LTS releases.

This book will deal with the folowing topics.
    
* Compilation of Kernel
* Code Walkthrough using ``cscope`` and ``ctags``
* Kernel Modules
* Kernel Module Programming
* Proc Interface
* Data Strucutures available in the Kernel
* Character Device Drivers

The section has many ``Hands-On`` exercises which will enable you to learn
how to write code for kernel modules, and make changes to the linux kernel.
This section is very essential for getting a good feel of kernel
programming.

Note that the book is entirely not my work, I have taken references from a lot
of documents and articles from the open source community.

Happy Hacking !!
